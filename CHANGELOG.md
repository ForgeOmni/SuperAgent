## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **AgentManager** - New registry and loader for agent definitions, mirroring SkillManager's architecture
  - `AgentDefinition` abstract base class for defining agent types
  - 4 built-in agent types extracted from AgentTool (general-purpose, code-writer, researcher, reviewer)
  - `loadFromDirectory()` and `loadFromFile()` for loading from any path
- **Markdown file support** - Both skills and agents can now be defined as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter
  - `MarkdownSkill` and `MarkdownAgentDefinition` classes
  - `MarkdownFrontmatter` parser (uses ext-yaml/symfony-yaml if available, otherwise built-in parser)
  - All frontmatter fields preserved and accessible via `getMeta()`
  - Placeholders (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$LANGUAGE`, etc.) left for LLM interpretation, not program substitution
- **Claude Code compatibility** - `load_claude_code` config flag for all three modules
  - Skills: auto-loads from `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/skills/`
  - Agents: auto-loads from `.claude/agents/`
  - MCP: auto-loads from `.mcp.json` (project) and `~/.claude.json` (user), with `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` environment variable expansion
- **MCP custom paths** - `mcp.paths` config for loading additional MCP server JSON config files
- **`loadFromJsonFile()`** on MCPManager for loading MCP configs from any JSON file

### Changed
- `SkillManager::loadFromDirectory()` now parses namespace from source files instead of hardcoding `App\SuperAgent\Skills\`
- `SkillManager::parseArguments()` now collects non key=value text into `arguments` key for `$ARGUMENTS` substitution
- `AgentTool` now resolves agent types via `AgentManager` instead of hardcoded match statements
- Default paths (`.claude/skills`, `.claude/agents`) removed from config — replaced by `load_claude_code` toggle
- `MCPManager::loadConfiguration()` now accepts both SuperAgent format (`servers`) and Claude Code format (`mcpServers`)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Multiple Named Provider Instances** - Support registering multiple instances of the same provider type (e.g. multiple Anthropic-compatible APIs) with different configurations
- New `driver` config field to decouple instance name from provider class selection
- All provider types now supported in `Agent::resolveProvider()` (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Bedrock, Ollama)
- Documentation for multi-provider instance usage in both English and Chinese READMEs

### Changed
- `Agent::resolveProvider()` now uses a `driver` field to determine which provider class to instantiate, falling back to the provider name for backward compatibility
